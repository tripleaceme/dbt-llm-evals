## Getting Started

When you're ready to start working on an issue, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/dbt-llm-evals.git`
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature-branch` or `git checkout -b fix/my-bug-fix`
4. Install dependencies: `dbt™ deps`

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- dbt-core >= 1.6.0
- Access to at least one supported warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery, or Databricks)
- Warehouse AI functions enabled

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
dbt deps

# Set up pre-commit hooks
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Run models
dbt run --select tag:llm_evals
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to enforce code quality. Hooks run automatically on `git commit` and include:

- **Trailing whitespace & EOF fixes** — consistent file formatting
- **YAML validation** — catches syntax errors in dbt YAML configs
- **SQLFluff** — SQL linting with dbt-aware templating
- **Ruff** — fast Python linting and formatting
- **yamlfmt** — YAML formatting consistency

To run hooks manually against all files:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Running Tests

Make sure all tests pass before submitting a pull request:

```bash
# Install test dependencies
poetry install

# Run Python validation tests
poetry run pytest

# Run compilation checks
dbt compile --select tag:llm_evals
dbt parse
```

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style and dbt best practices
- Use meaningful variable and model names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep SQL queries readable with proper indentation
- Ensure your code passes all tests

### Adding New Features

1. **New Evaluation Criteria**
   - Add to `build_judge_prompt` macro in `macros/judge/build_judge_prompt.sql`

   - Update README with setup instructions

3. **New Monitoring Features**
   - Add model to `models/monitoring/`
   - Document in schema YAML
   - Add to README

### Testing

- All new features must include tests
- Test on target warehouse if adding adapter-specific code
- Integration tests should use sample data

### Documentation
